alt_text: A cute chibi character making a peace sign with both hands and winking, displaying tearful eyes and trembling lips. They are lying on their side asleep with a tiny pillow, a warm smile on their face. The character is pointing confidently, surrounded by shining visual effects. Heart symbols float around as they blow a kiss. The background is vibrant red with colorful confetti elements, and there is clean white space around the character.
