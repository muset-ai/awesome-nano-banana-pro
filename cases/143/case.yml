alt_text: 'A man with a face identical to the uploaded selfie, dressed like the main character from GTA: Vice City, leans against a retro 1980s sports car on Ocean Drive. The background features art-deco buildings, palm trees, neon signs, and a pink-purple sunset reflecting on wet asphalt.

prompt: 'The man attached in the uploaded reference image with the exact face from the uploaded selfie — same features, same proportions, same expression, no changes. Dressed like the GTA: Vice City main character, leaning against a retro 1980s sports car  Ocean Drive. Background: art-deco buildings, palm trees, neon signs, and a pink-purple Miami sunset reflecting on wet asphalt. Neon glow on the car and pavement, soft blur of nightlife in motion. Low-angle cinematic shot, dramatic shadows, ultra-realistic look, strong 1980s Vice City vibe.'
