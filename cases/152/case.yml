prompt: "Create an ultra-realistic portrait of the uploaded person standing indoors beside a giant Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey bottle prop. The person should keep their exact face, hairstyle, skin tone, and body shape from the uploaded photo. They wear a black suit, white shirt, no tie, and black shoes. They hold a glass of whiskey in one hand while resting the other arm on the oversized whiskey bottle.\r\n\r\nShow a premium wooden bar interior in the background, with dark brown shelves filled with neatly arranged liquor bottles of different shapes, colors, and labels. Add warm ambient lighting from small ceiling spotlights that create soft highlights on the bottle shelves. Use a clean marble countertop edge behind them.\r\n\r\nThe giant Jack Daniel’s bottle must look highly realistic: transparent glass with warm amber whiskey inside, clear reflections, crisp highlights, and accurate bottle contours. The front label should follow the Jack Daniel’s style (white text on black background), but avoid exact real-world text; use stylized placeholder lettering similar in style. Make the bottle much taller than the person’s waist and almost reach shoulder height.\r\n\r\nUse a clean full-body framing, straight-on camera angle at eye level, with natural depth of field so the person and bottle are in sharp focus while the background has slight soft blur. Maintain even, warm-toned lighting with gentle shadows under the person’s shoes and subtle reflections on the polished floor. The mood should feel classy, calm, and premium, like a professional event photo.\r\n\r\nKeep the final output photorealistic with clear skin texture, crisp suit fabric details, realistic glass reflections, and accurate color balance."
